# hmyweb3.py

**This library only supports Python 3.6+.**  

A library that monkeypatch [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py)
allowing code written to interact with Ethereum blockchain using web3 to
also be ported to the Harmony blockchain with just a few changes to the
codebase compared to migrating to the official
[pyhmy](https://github.com/harmony-one/pyhmy) library.

## Installation

`setup.py` has not been written yet. Just drop the `hmyweb3` folder into
the root folder of your project for now.

## Disclaimer

**This library, as of current state, does not feature all of Harmony's
RPC API methods. This library also does not have any testing done so
bugs are likely to be expected.**
